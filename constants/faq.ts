          "The location of today's Dillo Day, the Northwestern Lakefill, is on the homelands of the people of the Council of Three Fires, the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa as well as the Menominee, Miami and Ho-Chunk nations. Mayfest Productions believes providing more context is essential given this year's theme, Camp Dillo. The theme of summer camps often invokes racist Native American tropes and mascots, while also creating a colonial dichotomy between “nature” vs. “civilization” that stems from Native American genocide and white supremacy. Mayfest Productions acknowledges that summer camps often serve as a site of Indigenous appropriation, such as hosting powwows and appropriating Native cultures within their programming (cabins are “tribes,” camp directors are “Chiefs”) and commits to rejecting discriminatory tropes and imagery.",
          'Northwestern is also in close proximity to an urban Indigenous community in Chicago and near several tribes in the Midwest. Pre-colonization, the Indigenous communities in the area had established a vast network of trails and portages, and had a robust trading network. By 1833, most Indigenous communities were displaced from the region after signing coercive treaties. The 1833 Treaty of Chicago was signed before the creation of Northwestern’s lakefill in 1962-1964. The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi laid claim to this land east of Michigan Avenue created by landfill in the 1980s and thereafter. For the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa—the Council of Three Fires—Lake Michigan is not just a body of water but a vital cultural, spiritual, and economic resource. The creation of the lakefill altered these traditional and sacred spaces, changing the natural shoreline and disrupting the ecological balance of the area.',
          "The ongoing and current oppression of Indigenous peoples persists today globally. Generations of government policies of forced removal, land seizures and violence have been inflicted on Native peoples. Food insecurity and poverty are high among Native communities today, at roughly double the rate of white Americans. On the Northwestern campus alone, the John Evans Center is named after one of Northwestern's founders John Evans, who had direct involvement in the Sand Creek Massacre, the mass murder of Cheyenne and Arapaho people. According to a report by the University of Denver, Evans’s actions as territorial governor set the conditions for a massacre to occur. Northwestern continues to develop on stolen land; The Pokagon Band of the Potawatomi Indians Tribal Historic Preservation Office wrote to the City of Evanston and Northwestern over concerns of the new Ryan Field construction disturbing ancestral burials and archaeologically sensitive sites.",
          'We urge non-Native attendees to educate themselves about the ongoing struggles Indigenous communities face today as a result of past and contemporary colonial projects, including those perpetrated by the Northwestern University Board of Trustees. We have included a list of resources and links to learn more about the current issues Native communities are facing. We encourage you to learn about and support Indigenous-led movements meant to combat colonial oppression, such as the Land Back Movement.',
          "Finally, to expand our action beyond statements, Mayfest Productions is encouraging Mayfest members and all Northwestern community members to attend the NAISA Spring Pow Wow on April 27th, and the Center for Native American and Indigenous Research and Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion's Lunch & Learn and Q&A hosted by Dave Spencer from Oka Homma Singers on April 25th. Your participation will help contribute directly to the knowledge of this land's history.",
