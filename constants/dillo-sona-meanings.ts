  lovers: `You LOVE love – and honestly it shows. You thrive on harmony and deep emotional connection, whether you’re planning cute picnic dates or belting your heart out to love songs in your room at 2 am. You feel everything intensely, and while your heart sometimes battles with your head, we know you’ll always choose what feels right.`,

  tower: `We know you don’t shy away from chaos. Your energy is bold, intense, and transformational. One day you’re redecorating your apartment at 3 am and the next you’re crowd-surfing in a sea of strangers – and somehow it all makes perfect sense. You shake things up, and honestly, we’re here for it.`,

  fool: `You are one interesting character. The wide-eyed traveler who always loses their passport but somehow ends up exactly where they need to be. We know you love to try weird food at street markets, and say yes to spontaneous adventures..`,

  chariot: `Our unstoppable go-getter! What would we do without you. You’re confident, focused, and probably already finished today’s to-do list as we speak. Whether it’s waking up at 5 am for a workout, getting way into arm-wrestling contests, or dropping TED Talks in casual conversations – your presence is always heard.`,

  sun: `Hello, our ray of sunshine! You have an infectiously happy, enthusiastic, and bright personality that makes everyone feel seen. You may or may not laugh too loudly at your own jokes in public and have an entire album on your phone of just sunset pics. Nonetheless, we love that you bring warmth and positivity wherever you go.`,

  moon: `When we looked up “nonchalant” in the dictionary, a picture of you popped up. You have a mysterious, intuitive, and emotionally deep personality. Whether it’s creating moody playlists for hyper-specific scenarios or disappearing for a weekend of introspection, we see you. You are the creative and dreamy card in the deck.`,
