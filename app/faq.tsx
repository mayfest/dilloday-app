          "The location of today's Dillo Day, the Northwestern Lakefill, is on the homelands of the people of the Council of Three Fires, the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa as well as the Menominee, Miami and Ho-Chunk nations. Mayfest Productions believes providing more context is essential given this year's theme, Camp Dillo. The theme of summer camps often invokes racist Native American tropes and mascots, while also creating a colonial dichotomy between “nature” vs. “civilization” that stems from Native American genocide and white supremacy. Mayfest Productions acknowledges that summer camps often serve as a site of Indigenous appropriation, and commits to rejecting discriminatory tropes and imagery. Since the origin of summer camp, campers and camp organizations have engaged in caricatured, stolen Indigenous traditions, like hosting powwows and appropriating Native cultures within their programming (cabins are “tribes,” camp directors are “Chiefs”) or camp names.",
          "Northwestern is also in close proximity to an urban Indigenous community in Chicago and near several tribes in the Midwest. Pre-colonization, the Indigenous communities in the area had established a vast network of trails and portages, or places to carry and drag boats from one water system to another, and had a robust trading network. By 1833, most Indigenous communities were displaced from the region after they were pressured to sign a series of coercive treaties. The 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which was taken as a surrender to Indigenous peoples' claims to Chicagoland, was signed before the creation of Northwestern's lakefill in 1962-1964. The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi laid claim to this land east of Michigan Avenue created by landfill in the 1980s and thereafter. For the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa—the Council of Three Fires—Lake Michigan is not just a body of water but a vital cultural, spiritual, and economic resource. Native peoples have historically depended on the Great Lakes for transportation, sustenance, trade, and ceremonial purposes, viewing them as sacred spaces with significant spiritual importance. The creation of the lakefill altered these traditional and sacred spaces. This act changed the natural shoreline and disrupted the ecological balance of the area. So, as we convene on the university's lakefill, we encourage you to reflect on its history and relationship with the original stewards of this land.",
          "The ongoing and current oppression of Indigenous peoples persists today globally. Generations of government policies of forced removal, land seizures and violence have been inflicted on Native peoples. Food insecurity and poverty are high among Native communities today, at roughly double the rate of white Americans. On the Northwestern campus alone, the John Evans Center is named after one of Northwestern's founders John Evans, who had direct involvement in the Sand Creek Massacre, the mass murder of Cheyenne and Arapaho people. According to a report conducted by the University of Denver, Evans's actions as the territorial governor of Colorado, such as violence-inciting proclamations and neglect of treaty-negotiation duties, set the conditions for a massacre to occur. Northwestern continues to develop on stolen land; The Pokagon Band of the Potawatomi Indians Tribal Historic Preservation Office wrote to the City of Evanston and Northwestern over concerns of the new Ryan Field construction and its disturbance of ancestral burials and archaeologically sensitive sites, as seen on Evanston's Land Use Commission's website. Northwestern has yet to acknowledge if archaeological oversight will take place during construction.",
          'We would like to use this opportunity to urge non-Native attendees to educate themselves about the ongoing struggles Indigenous communities face today as a result of past and contemporary colonial projects, including those perpetrated by the Northwestern University Board of Trustees. We have included a list of resources and links to pages to learn more about the current issues Native communities are suffering from. We urge you to learn about and support Indigenous-led movements meant to combat colonial oppression, such as the Land Back Movement.',
          "Finally, to expand our action beyond statements, Mayfest Productions is encouraging Mayfest members and all Northwestern community members to attend the NAISA Spring Pow Wow on April 27th, an effort that aligns with our commitment to supporting meaningful community initiatives. We also encourage students to attend the Center for Native American and Indigenous Research and Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion's Lunch & Learn and accompanying Q&A hosted by Dave Spencer (Mississippi Chata/Diné) from Oka Homma Singers on April 25th to prepare for attending the Pow Wow. Your participation will help contribute directly to the knowledge of the history of this land.",
